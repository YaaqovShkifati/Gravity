# Gravity

 * Description: Gravity was first discovered by a famous physicist and
 * mathematician named Sir Isaac Newton. While studying the motion of plants at 
 * Cambridge University, he saw a falling apple while thinking about the forces 
 * of nature.  Regardless of what really happened, Newton realized that some
 * force must be acting on falling objects like apples because otherwise they
 * would not start moving from rest. Then he started thinking about his third
 * law of motion," for each action there is equal and opposite reaction".
 * Newton questioned if the apple was moving towards the Earth, and wondered
 * why the Earth doesn't move towards the apple? Then he questioned if the moon
 * also falls just like the apples. Newton concluded that the orbit of the Moon
 * was of exactly the same nature: The Moon continuously "fell" in its path
 * around the Earth because of the acceleration due to gravity, thus producing
 * its orbit. He came  to the conclusion by applying a formula from his second
 * law of motion, F=ma. There is a force which is responsible for the motion of
 * the plants, for the attractions between two bodies. This force between any
 * two bodies, is directly proportional of the product of two mass and inversely
 * proportional to the square of the center to center distance. F= GMm/r^2 is
 * known  as the gravitational force. This breakthrough helped precisely predict
 * projectile motion and celestial motion. However, Mercury doesn't follow the
 * precession that is predicted by Newtonian mechanics. About 225 years later,
 * a brilliant physicist named Albert Einstein discovered a new theory of
 * gravity called General Relativity. He argued that gravity is a not a force
 * but only a result of the fabric of space and time (space-time) being curved
 * due to large masses. The use of non-Euclidean geometry helped Einstein
 * conclude a geometric equation of gravity. With this new revolution of our
 * understanding of gravity, it helped us to understand; space, time, motion of
 * the objects as they approached the speed of light, and how Mercury orbits
 * around the sun.

 * We will be using the trailer method to write this program. This method is
 * effective when you use the a method name while. While is a type of loop which
 * does repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is
 * true. The condition may be any expression, and true is any non zero value.
 * What will do is create while loop with the condition that the plant is name
 * is  not equal to "done". Then we will signal the data to stop by entering
 * done and that is our trailer.
